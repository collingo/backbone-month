// LESSON 2: COLLECTIONS
// 1. Extend Backbone.Collection to create a new Collection called Todos
 
// 2. Define a sort function that automatically sorts the collection by completed state
 
// 3. Create an instance of Todos called myTodoList
 
// 4. Add the Todo models you created in Lesson 1 to this Collection
 
// 5. Add a third Todo to this collection with a description of 'eat a cat'
 
// 6. Filter the collection to exclude completed Todos, and store the output in a new array called completedTodos
 
// 7. BONUS: Log the text "Updated!" to the console whenever a todo is added, changed or removed from the collection
